        /*
        Arrays Class methods:
        Arrays is a Class it is not an object



        observation: method taht accept external data when being called
        method that does not accept external data when being called
        ----
        method that genrates some type of result taht can be saved
        method that does not generate any result, just plain action
        ----
        method that need an object when being called
        method that does not need an object when beeing called

        METHOD:

        reusable piece of code that helps to perform certain action when beeing called!


        String abc = " Java"  --> java is string object!

         String b = scan.next ();  --> scan is an object

* public : access modifier; open to public everyone can see
*static  : no object needed to call ;
*void    : return type(none in this case) void mean nothing in english just takes action
*main    : method name can be anything hold your horse for ex
*()      : method parameters(none in this case)
or
methods parameters : (String[] args) : anything that goes inside the () called methods parameters

creating a method :
is all about putting block of code belong together and also separated from other part of code!!!! VERY IMPORTANT
