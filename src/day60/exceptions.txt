----------------   throw VS thorws --------------
throws keyword is used to document a method might throw that type of exception
public static void playWithFire throws GetBurnedException{
    // some code here
}
this is the only place you will see throws keywrod
in (any) method declareation and is not used anywhere else.
we will not use new keyword after throws
Since throws are used to document it might throw an exception
can i documemnt more than one type?
// assuming these exceptions actually exists
public void skyDiving() throws DiveTooDeepException, TooScareException,
                                ParachuteNotWorkingException {
                                }

          // you do not NEED to actually throw the exception
          //method only shows that exception MIGHT happen
throw keyword
Its used to actually programaitically throw the exception to the runtime system
just like actually breaking the glass rather than telling it might break
for example :  throw new AnyTypeOfException( optional message here) .
    What can you throw ?????


    HOW to create custom Exception ?

    how to create your own unchecked exception type:
    BreakTimeException
    BrainOutOfMemoryException

    What is unchecked exception -- anything IS - A Runtime Exception

    so, ALL you need is to create a subclass of RUntimeException with my own name!

    public class BreakTimeException extends RuntimeException (or any subclass of it ){

    }

    how to create your own checked exception type:

    so, ALL you need is to create a subclass of any checked Exception with my own name!

        public class HittingHeadToWall extends Exception ( or any subclass of it , like : IOException {

        }
